[h1]Current Version: 1.4.1 "Eiffel Tower" (Released 07/04/23, Compatible with vanilla patch 1.3.6)[/h1]

VTM, or Victoria Tweaks Mod, is a mod that aims to enhance the overall gameplay experience while sticking to the core design philosophies of Victoria 3. Implemented features are designed with a lightweight, easy-to-use feature implementation in mind. Mechanical reworks go hand in hand with extensive changes to AI behaviour and many other elements.

[B]VTM is unlikely to be compatible with any similar mods as its changes are fluid and touch many aspects of the game[/B]. The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2888391145][B]Extra Topbar Info Mod[/B][/url] is compatible with this mod. VTM comes first in the load order, then ETI.

[h1]VTM currently touches on many major and minor issues. This is a short list of major features:[/h1]
[*][B]Population Growth Revamp:[/B] Population growth as a whole has been revamped. You will reach your highest growth at a much lower SoL and then drop off much faster. Pop growth worldwide should be closer to historical numbers.
[*][B]Colonial Claims:[/B] Great Powers gain claims in Africa, Oceania and Indonesia when their colony has grown large enough to limit other powers from competing in the same state region. A claim is granted when one Great Power controls 50% of a state region - Great Powers with colonies in that state region that own at least 20% of it also get a claim.
[*][B]Colonial Gameplay:[/B] Imperialist AI countries now eliminate native countries, challenge one another over colonies more reliably and utilise the new colonisation system seamlessly. Colonial Exploitation is now more exploitative. The overlord of the British India Company can now transfer regional possessions to the BIC similar to what the overlord of the DEI can do. 
[*][B]French Internal Gameplay:[/B] Various changes have been made to French content. The French Monarchists will form their own parties, cementing your dynasty will take longer and some things have been changed such as the effect of the Natural Borders JE. 
[*][B]National Unifications:[/B] Scandinavia is no longer a major unification, Austria has more options when winning the Brothers War, the requirements to form Germany have been changed and Italy has some unique strats (WIP however)
[*][B]Ideologies & Laws:[/B]Various changes have been made to ideologies and laws to make them more aligned. Radicals are now primarily pushing for civil rights, different IGs are getting slightly different and often more stances.
[*][B]Light Economy Changes:[/B] Urban centres are now likely to be profitable as services are much less overproduced, which ultimately leads to the consumer economy and the Petite Bourgeoisie functioning better.
[*][B]Light Economy Changes:[/B] Two new game rules have been introduced that are both off by default - 1.) Whether France has a reduced birth rate and 2.) Whether AI Prussia can form the NGF should it lose the Brothers War to create a more dynamic world.
[*][B]Springtime of the Peoples other Flavour:[/B] Springtime of the Peoples is easier to trigger, clearly communicates when it spreads and is generally more impactful, leading to real unrest all over Europe. The Strike JE has been fixed. Romania has its own JE and can unify. Austria can form an SGF vassal should it be influential enough in South Germany.
[*][B]Japanese Chaos Theory:[/B] I live in Japan's walls.
[*][B]Cold Water Ports:[/B] [/B][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997299912][B]Cold Water Ports by jobarin has been integrated into VTM![/B][/url]
[*][B]Many minor changes:[/B] Many other minor changes have been made. Legitimacy levels have different impacts, the AI generally behaves differently and various smaller things have been fixed, altered or expanded.
