 sca_culture_event.1.t:0 "The Finnish Question"
 sca_culture_event.1.d:0 "Considering our shared history, we should consider lifting the Finnish to an equal culture"
 sca_culture_event.1.f:0 "The Finnish people too live on the Nordic Peninsula. They however speak a tongue that is foreign to us Scandinavians. It has been hotly debated whether we can even call them Nordic. The question however remains. Should we openly accept the Finnish or are they just too different from us?"

 sca_culture_event.2.f:0 "Estonia has a long history with the Scandinavian countries. Being ruled by both the Danes and Swedes for centuries the people living there have absorbed many of their customs. With the elevation of Finnish to a national culture, maybe Estonian should follow."

 sca_culture_event.2.b:0 "“Finnish is unintelligible. I dare not hope for what horrors the Estonian language will bring?”"

 carib_event.1.d:0 "After many months, the Constitution is finally done. The only thing left to do is sign it. But who should have the honor?"
 carib_event.1.f:0 "What might seem as a simple act, the signer of the constitution wields an enormous amount of influence, instantly gaining their place in history. If we let the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] sign it, they will become a national hero. This proposition has been criticized as this might increase authoritarianism and has instead proposed that the signing be placed in the hands of the people."

Sure, they might have seen the same beaches and trees, but they have not toiled as we have. Is a past of suppression a core value of the Caribbean culture, or can we break bread with those that once ruled over us?"

 carib_event.4.d:0 "After much deliberation the location has finally been chosen. The capital shall be on... "
 carib_event.4.f:0 "The placement of our capital is a highly important and delicate matter. We are a nation of Spanish, French, and English-speaking people with no common ancestral ground in the Caribbean.
